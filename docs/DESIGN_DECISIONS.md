## 1. YouTube Player Architecture

**Date:** October 2025
**Context:** Need to integrate YouTube IFrame API with Next.js React application for audio-only music playback

### Problem

The YouTube IFrame API directly manipulates the DOM by injecting iframes. When the player container is managed by React, this causes hydration errors:

```
Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node
```

**Root Cause:**
- React expects server-rendered HTML to match client-side hydration
- YouTube API injects DOM nodes between server render and client hydration
- React's reconciliation fails when it encounters unexpected DOM modifications

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Conditional Rendering with `isMounted`**
   - Only render player after component mounts
   - **Rejected:** Race condition persisted between mount and API initialization

2. **Two-Phase Mounting with `isHydrated`**
   - Separate mount detection from hydration completion
   - Use `requestAnimationFrame` and `setTimeout` delays
   - **Rejected:** Timing was brittle and unreliable, errors still occurred

3. **Third-Party Library** (`react-youtube`, `react-player`)
   - Use established library with hydration handling
   - **Rejected:** Wanted to understand the root cause and maintain direct control over player API

4. **Portal-Based Approach**
   - Render player using React Portal outside main tree
   - **Rejected:** Still within React's control, would have same reconciliation issues

5. **Complete SSR Opt-Out**
   - Make entire app client-side rendered
   - **Rejected:** Defeats Next.js benefits (SEO, performance)

### Decision

**Create the YouTube player container completely outside of React's control**

```typescript
// In YouTubePlayerContext.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Create container outside React DOM
  const playerContainer = document.createElement('div');
  playerContainer.id = 'youtube-player-container';
  playerContainer.style.cssText = 'position:absolute;width:0;height:0;overflow:hidden;';
  document.body.appendChild(playerContainer);

  // Initialize YouTube player on external container
  const player = new YT.Player('youtube-player-container', {
    videoId: DEFAULT_VIDEO_ID,
    // ... configuration
  });

  // Cleanup on unmount
  return () => {
    player.destroy();
    playerContainer.remove();
  };
}, []);
```

### Rationale

- **Separation of Concerns:** Player DOM manipulation happens outside React's virtual DOM
- **No Reconciliation Conflicts:** React never tries to reconcile YouTube API's changes
- **Industry Standard:** This is how production apps integrate Google Maps, YouTube, Canvas, and other DOM-manipulating libraries
- **Clean Lifecycle:** Container creation and cleanup are explicit and predictable
- **Full API Access:** Maintains complete access to YouTube IFrame API without wrapper abstractions

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero hydration errors
- ✅ Predictable lifecycle management
- ✅ Full YouTube API control
- ✅ Maintains all Next.js SSR benefits for rest of app

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Player container is outside React DevTools visibility
- ⚠️ Requires manual DOM manipulation (acceptable for this isolated case)
- ⚠️ Must manually manage cleanup in useEffect return function

**Future Considerations:**
- This pattern applies to any third-party library that directly manipulates DOM
- Document this approach for future integrations (maps, charts, video players)
- Consider creating a reusable hook pattern: `useExternalDOMElement()`

## 2. Background Image System

**Date:** October 2025
**Context:** Establish visual identity that reinforces the dual music/engineering brand across all pages

### Problem

Homepage hero section has thematic split (music left, engineering right), but blog and music pages lacked visual cohesion with this branding. Pages felt disconnected from the homepage's established visual language.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Different Images Per Page**
   - Unique hero images for each page
   - **Rejected:** Would dilute the music/tech split brand identity

2. **Full Background Across Entire Page**
   - Backgrounds extend the full page height
   - **Rejected:** Would distract from content, especially on long pages

3. **Fixed Position Backgrounds**
   - Backgrounds stay in place while content scrolls
   - **Rejected:** Creates jarring visual disconnect as content scrolls past

4. **No Backgrounds on Interior Pages**
   - Keep backgrounds only on homepage
   - **Rejected:** Missed opportunity to reinforce brand identity

### Decision

**Implement thematic split backgrounds on music and blog pages, consistent with homepage aesthetic**

**Specifications:**
```typescript
// Music Page - Guitar/music image on LEFT half only
<div className="absolute left-0 top-0 w-1/2 h-screen overflow-hidden hidden md:block">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-background-primary/50 via-60% to-background-primary">
    <Image
      src="/music-background.jpg"
      style={{ opacity: 0.15, filter: 'blur(3px) brightness(0.6)' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

// Blog/Engineering Page - Code/tech image on RIGHT half only
<div className="absolute right-0 top-0 w-1/2 h-screen overflow-hidden hidden md:block">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-l from-transparent via-background-primary/50 via-60% to-background-primary">
    <Image
      src="/code-background.jpg"
      style={{ opacity: 0.15, filter: 'blur(3px) brightness(0.6)' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

**Visual Design Rules:**
- **Position:** `absolute` (scrolls with content, not fixed)
- **Height:** `h-screen` (viewport height only, not full page)
- **Opacity:** 15% with 3px blur and brightness(0.6) - very subtle
- **Horizontal Fade:**
  - Music fades left-to-right (toward center)
  - Tech fades right-to-left (toward center)
- **Vertical Fade:** `from-transparent via-background-primary/50 via-60% to-background-primary`
- **Responsive:** `hidden md:block` (desktop only, hidden on mobile)

### Rationale

**Consistency:**
- Reinforces homepage split-screen visual language
- Music = left side, Engineering = right side
- Creates cohesive brand experience across site

**Subtle Enhancement:**
- Low opacity (15%) ensures content remains primary focus
- Blur and brightness reduction prevent distraction
- Fades ensure seamless blend with solid backgrounds

**Performance:**
- Backgrounds only in viewport height (`h-screen`)
- Hidden on mobile to reduce data usage and visual clutter
- Static images (can be optimized/cached)

**User Experience:**
- Scrolling backgrounds feel natural (position: absolute)
- Gradual fade prevents harsh cutoff at bottom
- Center fade creates focus on content area

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Stronger brand identity across all pages
- ✅ Visual continuity from homepage to interior pages
- ✅ Subtle enhancement that doesn't overwhelm content
- ✅ Mobile performance optimized (backgrounds hidden)

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Adds ~200-400KB to page weight (desktop only)
- ⚠️ Requires careful image selection to maintain subtlety
- ⚠️ Must maintain left/right consistency when adding new pages

**Implementation Pattern for New Pages:**
```typescript
// For music-related pages: use LEFT background
{/* Music Background - LEFT */}
<div className="absolute left-0 top-0 w-1/2 h-screen overflow-hidden hidden md:block">
  {/* ... music background ... */}
</div>

// For engineering/blog pages: use RIGHT background
{/* Code Background - RIGHT */}
<div className="absolute right-0 top-0 w-1/2 h-screen overflow-hidden hidden md:block">
  {/* ... code background ... */}
</div>

// For pages that blend both (e.g., homepage): use BOTH
{/* Both backgrounds with bottom fade */}
```

## 3. Streaming Platform Links

**Date:** October 2025
**Context:** Replace Spotify embed player with quick-access links to multiple streaming platforms

### Problem

Original design used an embedded Spotify player, but Spotify embeds only play 30-second preview clips for non-premium users. This creates a poor experience for visitors who want to listen to full tracks.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Spotify Embed with Disclaimer**
   - Add text explaining 30-second limit
   - **Rejected:** Doesn't solve the core problem of limited playback

2. **YouTube Embed for Full Playback**
   - Use YouTube embedded player for full songs
   - **Implemented separately** as full-page player with mini-player in header

3. **Single "Listen on Spotify" Button**
   - Just one link to Spotify profile
   - **Rejected:** Doesn't serve users on other platforms

4. **Automatic Platform Detection**
   - Detect user's preferred service and show only that link
   - **Rejected:** Too complex, users may have multiple preferences

### Decision

**Create a StreamingLinks component with buttons for multiple platforms: Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, YouTube Music**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// StreamingLinks.tsx
export default function StreamingLinks() {
  const [config, setConfig] = useState<SiteConfig[]>([]);

  // Fetch streaming platform URLs from Supabase
  useEffect(() => {
    getSiteConfig('music_social').then(setConfig);
  }, []);

  const platforms = [
    { key: 'spotify_url', label: 'Spotify', icon: <SpotifyIcon /> },
    { key: 'apple_music_url', label: 'Apple Music', icon: <AppleMusicIcon /> },
    { key: 'itunes_url', label: 'iTunes', icon: <iTunesIcon /> },
    { key: 'youtube_music_url', label: 'YouTube Music', icon: <YouTubeIcon /> },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      {platforms.map(platform => {
        const url = config.find(c => c.key === platform.key)?.value;
        if (!url) return null; // Only show if URL is configured

        return (
          <a href={url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            {platform.icon}
            <span>{platform.label}</span>
          </a>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Design Principles:**
- Buttons only display if corresponding URL is configured in Supabase
- Consistent visual treatment for all platforms
- Responsive grid: 2 columns mobile, 4 columns desktop
- External links open in new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

### Rationale

**User Choice:**
- Different users prefer different platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Provides quick access to all available options
- Users can choose their subscribed service

**Flexibility:**
- Easy to add new platforms via admin panel (just add URL to site_config)
- No code changes needed to enable/disable platforms
- Conditional rendering prevents showing empty/broken links

**Better UX than Embed:**
- No 30-second playback restrictions
- Links go directly to full catalog on user's preferred service
- Faster page load (no iframe embeds)

**Admin-Friendly:**
- All URLs managed through site config admin panel
- Can update links without touching code
- Can enable/disable platforms by simply adding/removing URLs

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Serves users across all major streaming platforms
- ✅ No playback restrictions (full songs available)
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update via admin panel
- ✅ Cleaner, faster page load than embeds

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Users leave site to listen (vs embedded player)
- ⚠️ Requires user to have account on at least one platform
- ⚠️ No in-page playback tracking/analytics

**Future Enhancements:**
- Could add platform-specific analytics tracking
- Consider adding Bandcamp, SoundCloud, or other platforms
- Potential to add "smart links" service (feature.fm, linkfire.com)

## 4. Site Config Organization

**Date:** October 2025
**Context:** Admin site config page was growing unwieldy with unsorted list of all configuration fields

### Problem

All site configuration fields were displayed in a single, unsorted list:
- Hard to find specific settings
- No logical grouping
- Didn't reflect mental model of different config categories
- Poor UX as config options increased

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Alphabetical Sorting**
   - Sort all fields A-Z
   - **Rejected:** Doesn't group related fields, still hard to navigate

2. **Tabs for Each Category**
   - Separate tab for each section
   - **Rejected:** Too much navigation overhead for relatively few fields

3. **Accordion Sections**
   - Collapsible sections for each category
   - **Rejected:** Adds unnecessary interaction for a relatively short page

4. **Keep Flat List**
   - Maintain current unsorted approach
   - **Rejected:** Doesn't scale as more config options are added

### Decision

**Reorganize admin site config into clearly labeled sections with visual cards**

**Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. General Settings                 │
│    - Profile Image                   │
│    - Hero Background Image           │
│    - Contact Email                   │
│    - Booking Email                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Streaming Music Platforms        │
│    - Spotify                         │
│    - Apple Music                     │
│    - iTunes                          │
│    - YouTube Music                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Social Media                      │
│    - Instagram                       │
│    - Facebook                        │
│    - TikTok                          │
│    - Twitter                         │
│    - Patreon                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Professional Links                │
│    - LinkedIn                        │
│    - GitHub                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 5. Featured Videos                   │
│    [Video 1 Card]                    │
│    [Video 2 Card]                    │
│    [Video 3 Card]                    │
│    [Video 4 Card]                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rationale

**Mental Model Alignment:**
- Groups reflect how admin thinks about configuration
- General settings = site-wide visuals and contact
- Streaming = where people can hear music
- Social Media = where to follow/engage
- Professional = career-related links
- Videos = featured YouTube content

**Scannable Organization:**
- Clear section headers make it easy to find what you need
- Logical flow from general to specific
- Related fields grouped together

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Section headers provide clear landmarks
- Consistent spacing and layout
- Featured Videos section visually distinct with cards

**Scalability:**
- Easy to add new fields to existing sections
- Can add new sections without disrupting layout
- Clear pattern for where new config options belong

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Significantly improved admin UX
- ✅ Faster to find and update specific settings
- ✅ Clearer mental model of configuration options
- ✅ Easy to extend with new config fields

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Slightly more code to maintain section groupings
- ⚠️ Must decide category when adding new config fields

**Pattern for Adding New Config Fields:**
```typescript
// Determine which section the new field belongs to
// Add to appropriate section in admin config component
// If new category needed, add new section header and container
```

## 5. Featured Videos UX Enhancement

**Date:** October 2025
**Context:** Improve admin experience for managing featured YouTube videos

### Problem

Original implementation had separate, scattered fields:
- `youtube_video_1`, `youtube_video_2`, `youtube_video_3`, `youtube_video_4`
- `youtube_video_1_title`, `youtube_video_2_title`, etc.

**Issues:**
- Fields were not visually grouped (ID and title separated in list)
- Required copying video ID from YouTube URL manually
- Required copying video title manually or typing it out
- Error-prone (easy to mix up which title goes with which video)

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Separate Fields**
   - Maintain current scattered field approach
   - **Rejected:** Poor UX, error-prone

2. **Single "Add Video" Form with Array Storage**
   - Store videos as JSON array in single config field
   - **Rejected:** Would require significant schema changes and doesn't work well with key-value config structure

3. **Modal Dialog for Each Video**
   - Pop-up modal to edit video details
   - **Rejected:** Unnecessary interaction overhead for simple form fields

4. **Automatic Title Fetch Only**
   - Keep separate fields but add auto-fetch button
   - **Rejected:** Still doesn't solve the grouping problem

### Decision

**Group video ID and title fields together in cards with "Quick Add" feature**

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Visual grouping in cards
<div className="border rounded-lg p-4">
  <h3 className="font-semibold mb-3">Featured Video 1</h3>

  {/* Quick Add Feature */}
  <div className="mb-3">
    <label className="block text-sm mb-1">Quick Add from YouTube URL</label>
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Paste YouTube URL here..."
        value={quickAddUrl}
        onChange={(e) => setQuickAddUrl(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleQuickAdd}>
        Extract & Fetch
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Individual fields (now grouped) */}
  <FormField id="youtube_video_1" label="Video ID" />
  <FormField id="youtube_video_1_title" label="Video Title" />
</div>
```

**Quick Add Flow:**
1. Admin pastes full YouTube URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
2. System extracts video ID: `dQw4w9WgXcQ`
3. System fetches title from YouTube oEmbed API (no API key required):
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch(
     `https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}&format=json`
   );
   const data = await response.json();
   const title = data.title;
   ```
4. Both fields auto-populate with ID and title

### Rationale

**Grouped Context:**
- Video ID and title are visually associated in a card
- Clear which title belongs to which video
- Labeled "Featured Video 1", "Featured Video 2", etc.

**Reduced Manual Work:**
- No need to manually extract video ID from URL
- No need to copy/paste or type title
- One action (paste URL + click) populates both fields

**Error Prevention:**
- Automatic ID extraction prevents typos
- Automatic title fetch ensures accuracy
- Grouped cards prevent mixing up videos

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Quick Add is optional convenience feature
- Can still manually enter ID and title if preferred
- Falls back gracefully if YouTube API unavailable

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Dramatically improved admin UX for video management
- ✅ Significantly faster to add/update videos
- ✅ Prevents errors from manual ID extraction
- ✅ Ensures accurate video titles

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Depends on YouTube oEmbed API availability
- ⚠️ Requires fetch call (minimal performance impact)
- ⚠️ Falls back to manual entry if API fails

**Technical Notes:**
- YouTube oEmbed API is public and requires no authentication
- oEmbed endpoint: `https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url={video_url}&format=json`
- Returns metadata including title, author, thumbnail
- Can be extended to auto-fetch thumbnail URLs in future

**Future Enhancements:**
- Could cache fetched titles to reduce API calls
- Could add thumbnail auto-fetch
- Could add video duration display
- Could add preview player in admin panel

## 6. YouTube Player Video-First Architecture

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Context:** Refactor YouTube player to enable continuous playback across pages with video-first approach

### Problem

The existing YouTube player architecture had several issues:

1. **Player Reinitialization Bug**: Callback dependencies on `playerState.videoId` caused the entire player to reinitialize on every track change
2. **Playback Stops on Navigation**: Container unmounted when leaving `/music` page, stopping audio
3. **Complex Audio/Video Toggling**: Unnecessary complexity managing `displayMode` state and `contentType` property
4. **DOM Manipulation Issues**: Moving iframe with `appendChild()` broke YouTube API's internal state

### Previous Architecture

- `displayMode` state toggled between 'audio' and 'video'
- `contentType` property on tracks ('audio' | 'video')
- Conditional rendering showed either video player or album cover
- Player container unmounted when navigating away from `/music` page

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Audio/Video Toggle**
   - Maintain separate modes for audio and video tracks
   - **Rejected:** All content is video on YouTube, toggle adds unnecessary complexity

2. **Move Iframe Between Containers**
   - Use `appendChild()` to move iframe from full player to mini player
   - **Rejected:** Breaks YouTube API's internal event handlers, causes cross-origin errors

3. **Multiple Player Instances**
   - Create separate player instances for different pages
   - **Rejected:** Can't maintain playback state, wastes resources

4. **Conditional Container Rendering**
   - Render container only when needed
   - **Rejected:** Causes player to reinitialize, interrupts playback

### Decision

**Implement video-first architecture with single persistent container and CSS-only positioning**

**Core Architectural Principles:**

1. **Single Persistent Container**: The `#youtube-player-container` div lives in root layout and never unmounts
2. **CSS-Only Positioning**: Video shown/hidden using CSS positioning, never conditional rendering
3. **Video-First**: All tracks treated as video content, displayed in full player
4. **Dynamic Overlay**: On `/music` page, container positioned over display area using `getBoundingClientRect()`
5. **Never Move the Iframe**: Positioning handled purely through CSS

**Key Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Container created outside React's control
useEffect(() => {
  const playerContainer = document.createElement('div');
  playerContainer.id = 'youtube-player-container';
  document.body.appendChild(playerContainer);

  const player = new YT.Player('youtube-player-container', { /* ... */ });

  return () => {
    player.destroy();
    playerContainer.remove();
  };
}, []);

// Dynamic positioning on /music page
useEffect(() => {
  const updatePosition = () => {
    const rect = videoContainerRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    playerContainer.style.position = 'fixed';
    playerContainer.style.left = `${Math.round(rect.left)}px`;
    playerContainer.style.top = `${Math.round(rect.top)}px`;
    // ... width, height, etc.
  };

  // Cleanup: hide when navigating away
  return () => {
    playerContainer.style.left = '-9999px';
    playerContainer.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
  };
}, []);
```

### Rationale

**Simplified Architecture:**
- No `displayMode` state management needed
- No conditional rendering of player types
- Single code path for all playback
- Clearer mental model

**Continuous Playback:**
- Player instance never destroyed during navigation
- Same YouTube iframe continues playing
- Audio seamless across page transitions
- Video reappears when returning to `/music` page

**Better Performance:**
- No player reinitialization on track change
- Stable callbacks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- CSS positioning faster than DOM manipulation
- requestAnimationFrame batches scroll updates

**Maintainability:**
- Fewer states to manage and debug
- Simpler component lifecycle
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented patterns

### Technical Decisions

#### Why Create Container Outside React?

**Problem**: YouTube IFrame API manipulates DOM directly, causing React hydration errors

**Solution**: Create container using vanilla DOM APIs outside React's virtual DOM

**Rationale**:
- Prevents React reconciliation conflicts
- Industry-standard pattern for third-party DOM libraries
- Zero hydration errors
- Full YouTube API control

#### Why requestAnimationFrame for Scroll?

**Problem**: Direct scroll event handler caused jittery movement

**Solution**: Use RAF to batch position updates to browser's refresh rate

**Rationale**:
- Smooth 60fps tracking in all directions
- Handles rapid scroll changes gracefully
- Prevents layout thrashing
- Better performance

#### Why Fixed Positioning Instead of Absolute?

**Problem**: Need precise overlay positioning that updates with scroll

**Solution**: Use `position: fixed` with `getBoundingClientRect()` coordinates

**Rationale**:
- Fixed positioning is relative to viewport
- `getBoundingClientRect()` returns viewport-relative coordinates
- Perfect match, no offset calculations needed
- Works correctly with scrolling

#### Why Callback Dependency Fix with Refs?

**Problem**: `handleError` depending on `playerState.videoId` caused chain reaction of reinitializations

**Solution**: Use `currentVideoIdRef.current` instead of state dependency

**Rationale**:
- Breaks dependency chain without losing access to current value
- Stable callback references
- Prevents unnecessary useEffect triggers
- Better performance

### Database Field Compatibility

**Decision**: Keep `content_type` column in database but ignore in frontend

**Rationale**:
- Non-breaking change for existing data
- Allows gradual migration
- Can remove column in future migration
- Preserves historical data

**Future**: Remove `content_type` column in next major database migration

### Implications

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Continuous playback across page navigation
- ✅ Simplified state management (no displayMode)
- ✅ Better performance (no reinitialization bug)
- ✅ Smoother scroll tracking (requestAnimationFrame)
- ✅ Clearer architecture (video-first)
- ✅ Zero React hydration errors
- ✅ Industry-standard third-party library integration

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Manual DOM manipulation for container (acceptable for this isolated case)
- ⚠️ Player container outside React DevTools visibility
- ⚠️ Requires careful cleanup in useEffect
- ⚠️ Database field `content_type` now unused (can be removed later)

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Users can browse site while listening to music
- No playback interruption when navigating
- Video reappears exactly where they left off
- Smooth scroll tracking without jitter
- Mini-player always accessible in header

**Developer Experience Improvements:**
- Simpler code with fewer states
- Clear patterns for similar integrations
- Well-documented architecture
- Easy to extend with new features
- Comprehensive testing checklist

### Future Enhancements

Enabled by this architecture:

1. **Picture-in-Picture Mode**: Browser PiP API to float video while browsing
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Space for play/pause, arrows for next/prev
3. **Auto-Advance**: Automatically play next track when current ends
4. **Video Quality Selector**: Allow users to choose resolution
5. **Playlist Shuffle**: Randomize playback order
6. **Queue System**: Allow adding tracks to play next
7. **Playback History**: Track listening history
8. **Lyrics Integration**: Display synchronized lyrics

### Files Modified

**Core Changes:**
1. `/lib/contexts/YouTubePlayerContext.tsx` - State management and callback dependency fix
2. `/components/music/YouTubePlayerContainer.tsx` - Persistent container (may be deprecated)
3. `/components/music/YouTubePlayerFull.tsx` - Positioning logic with getBoundingClientRect
4. `/components/music/YouTubePlayerMini.tsx` - Added next/previous buttons
5. `/components/layout/PlayerBar.tsx` - Simplified layout wrapper
6. `/app/layout.tsx` - Added YouTubePlayerProvider

**New Files:**
- `/components/ui/icons/PlayIcon.tsx`
- `/components/ui/icons/PauseIcon.tsx`
- `/components/ui/icons/VolumeIcon.tsx`
- `/components/ui/icons/ExpandIcon.tsx`

**Deleted Files:**
- `/components/music/YouTubePlayerEmbed.tsx` - No longer needed

### Testing Verification

Confirmed working:
- [x] Video displays on `/music` page within container bounds
- [x] Playback continues when navigating to other pages
- [x] Audio continues playing on all pages
- [x] Video reappears when returning to `/music` page
- [x] No playback interruption during navigation
- [x] Scroll tracking is smooth in both directions
- [x] Resize handling works correctly
- [x] Next/previous buttons work from mini-player
- [x] Volume persists across navigation
- [x] Progress bar shows correct position
- [x] No React hydration errors in console

### Lessons Learned

**Pattern for Third-Party Libraries:**
When integrating libraries that manipulate the DOM (YouTube, Google Maps, Canvas, etc.):
1. Create container outside React using `document.createElement()`
2. Initialize library on the external container
3. Clean up in useEffect return function
4. Never try to manage the container with React

**Pattern for Stable Callbacks:**
When callbacks need access to frequently-changing values:
1. Use refs to hold current values
2. Keep callback dependency array empty
3. Update refs without triggering recreations
4. Prevents cascade of unnecessary re-renders

**Pattern for Smooth High-Frequency Updates:**
For scroll, resize, mousemove, etc.:
1. Use `requestAnimationFrame` to batch updates
2. Add `{ passive: true }` to event listeners
3. Cancel pending frames in cleanup
4. Round pixel values to prevent sub-pixel issues

## Decision-Making Principles

Based on these decisions, the following principles emerge for future design choices:

### 1. User Experience First
- Optimize for the person using the interface (visitor or admin)
- Reduce friction and manual work wherever possible
- Prevent errors through good UX rather than validation alone

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Keep third-party integrations isolated from core application logic
- Separate data fetching from presentation
- Use appropriate tools for each layer (React for UI, vanilla DOM for external libraries)

### 3. Consistency and Patterns
- Establish visual patterns and stick to them (e.g., left=music, right=engineering)
- Use consistent grouping and organization principles
- Document patterns for future reference

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- Provide convenience features (Quick Add) without making them required
- Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- Maintain manual override options

### 5. Scalability Thinking
- Design for future growth (more config options, more platforms)
- Make it easy to add without refactoring
- Clear patterns for extension

### 6. Performance Awareness
- Optimize for mobile when appropriate (hide backgrounds)
- Minimize external dependencies
- Balance features with performance impact

## How to Use This Document

**When making a new design decision:**

1. Document the context and problem
2. List alternatives considered with rejection rationale
3. Describe the chosen solution with implementation details
4. Explain the rationale (why this choice?)
5. Outline implications (benefits, trade-offs, future considerations)

**When revisiting a decision:**

1. Check if the original context still applies
2. Evaluate if new alternatives are available
3. Assess if implications have changed
4. Update decision or add revision note

This document serves as institutional memory for the project, helping future developers (including future you) understand not just what was built, but why it was built that way.
