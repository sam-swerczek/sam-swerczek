# Songs Admin UI - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Built

A comprehensive admin interface for managing songs in your database, fully integrated with your existing Next.js + Supabase architecture.

## Files Created

### 1. Database Layer
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/lib/supabase/mutations.ts`**
  - All CRUD operations for songs
  - Featured song management
  - Reordering logic
  - Soft delete functionality

### 2. Utilities
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/lib/utils/youtube.ts`**
  - YouTube video ID extraction from URLs
  - Metadata fetching (title, artist, thumbnail)
  - Thumbnail URL generation
  - Duration formatting
  - Video validation

### 3. API Routes
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/app/api/songs/route.ts`**
  - GET /api/songs - List all songs
  - POST /api/songs - Create song
  - PUT /api/songs - Update song
  - DELETE /api/songs - Soft delete song
  - PATCH /api/songs - Reorder/set featured
  - Full authentication on all endpoints

### 4. Admin Pages
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/app/admin/songs/page.tsx`**
  - Server component
  - Fetches initial data
  - Protected by middleware

- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/app/admin/songs/SongsAdminClient.tsx`**
  - Client component
  - Interactive table view
  - Filtering and sorting
  - Reordering with up/down buttons
  - Delete confirmation
  - Success/error notifications

### 5. Components
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/components/admin/SongForm.tsx`**
  - Create/edit form
  - YouTube URL parsing and metadata fetching
  - Real-time validation
  - Image previews
  - All song fields with proper types

### 6. Documentation
- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/docs/SONGS_ADMIN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
  - Complete feature documentation
  - API reference
  - Architecture decisions
  - Troubleshooting guide

- **`/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/docs/SONGS_ADMIN_ARCHITECTURE.txt`**
  - Visual architecture diagrams
  - Data flow charts
  - Component hierarchy
  - State management

## How to Access

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/admin/songs
   ```

3. **You must be authenticated** - the middleware will redirect to `/admin/login` if not

## Quick Usage

### Add a New Song
1. Click "Add New Song" button
2. Paste a YouTube URL (e.g., `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
3. Form auto-fills title, artist, and thumbnail
4. Fill in any additional fields
5. Set as Active and/or Featured
6. Click "Create Song"

### Edit a Song
1. Click "Edit" on any song in the list
2. Modify fields
3. Click "Update Song"

### Reorder Songs
1. Use up/down arrow buttons next to each song
2. Changes save immediately

### Delete a Song
1. Click "Delete"
2. Confirm
3. Song is soft-deleted (set to inactive)

### Filter Songs
- Click filter buttons: All, Active, Inactive, Audio, Video, Featured
- Table updates instantly

## Features

### Automatic Features
- YouTube video ID extraction from any URL format
- Metadata fetching (title, artist, thumbnail) from YouTube
- Auto-incrementing display_order for new songs
- Automatic un-featuring of other songs when setting featured
- Real-time thumbnail previews
- Form validation before submission

### Manual Features
- Set content type (audio/video)
- Set custom album cover URL
- Add streaming links (Spotify, Apple Music)
- Add tags (comma-separated)
- Set release date
- Add description
- Set duration (seconds)

## No Dependencies Required

All functionality uses:
- Existing Supabase client
- Native browser APIs
- Existing UI components
- No additional packages needed

## Architecture Highlights

### Authentication
- Middleware protects `/admin/songs` route
- API routes verify authentication server-side
- Uses existing session management

### Data Flow
1. Server component fetches initial data with service role key
2. Client component manages UI state
3. API routes handle mutations
4. Mutations update database
5. UI refreshes after successful operations

### Featured Song Logic
- Only one song can be featured at a time
- Enforced at database mutation level
- Automatically unfeatures others when setting featured

### YouTube Integration
- No API key required (uses oEmbed API)
- Supports multiple URL formats
- Graceful fallback if metadata fetch fails
- Validates video ID format

## Build Notes

The build completed successfully with only minor warnings:
- ESLint warnings about using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>` (not critical)
- These can be fixed later for optimization but don't affect functionality

There is a pre-existing TypeScript error in `components/layout/PlayerBar.tsx` (line 38) related to `YouTubePlayerMini` props. This is unrelated to the Songs Admin UI.

## Testing Checklist

Before using in production:
- [ ] Test creating a song with YouTube URL
- [ ] Test creating a song with video ID only
- [ ] Test editing a song
- [ ] Test deleting a song
- [ ] Test reordering songs
- [ ] Test setting featured song
- [ ] Test all filters
- [ ] Test form validation (empty required fields)
- [ ] Test with invalid YouTube URL
- [ ] Test on mobile (responsive design)

## Integration with YouTube Player

The songs you add here will:
1. Be available via the existing `getSongs()` query
2. Feed into your YouTube player components
3. Support both audio and video content types
4. Include album covers, streaming links, and metadata

## Next Steps

1. **Test the admin UI** - Navigate to `/admin/songs` and try creating/editing songs
2. **Add some test songs** - Use any YouTube video URLs
3. **Verify on frontend** - Check that songs appear in your music player
4. **Customize if needed** - Adjust styling, add features, etc.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify authentication is working
3. Check Supabase connection
4. Review `/Users/samswerczek/Projects/Personal_Page/docs/SONGS_ADMIN_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for troubleshooting

## Key Files Reference

```
lib/supabase/mutations.ts          # Database operations
lib/utils/youtube.ts                # YouTube utilities
